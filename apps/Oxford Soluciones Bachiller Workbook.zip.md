The film was originally shot as a single film of 321 minutes, but was divided into two parts for the Indian market, as no theatre would agree to screen such a long film.  The first part was released on 22 June 2012, while the second part was released on 8 August 2012.  The film was also screened in its entirety at the Cannes Directors' Fortnight in 2012, where it received a standing ovation.  It was also screened at the Sundance Film Festival and the Toronto International Film Festival in 2013.
  
The film received widespread critical acclaim from both Indian and international critics. It was praised for its realistic portrayal of the coal mafia, its ensemble cast, its direction, cinematography, editing, music and dialogue.   The film was also noted for its violence and profanity, which some critics found excessive and disturbing.  The film was rated as one of the best films of 2012 by several critics and publications, and was included in The Guardian's list of the 100 greatest films of the 21st century in 2019.
